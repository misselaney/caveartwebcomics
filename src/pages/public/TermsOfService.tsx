        These Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern your access to and use of our services and any information, text, links, graphics, photos, audio, videos, or other materials or arrangements of materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Caveart website and its subdomains and affiliated websites (collectively referred to as &ldquo;Content&rdquo;). By using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms.
      </p>

      <p>
      We may revise the Terms from time to time, and when we do, the changes will not be retroactive.  The most current version of the Terms are always here at caveart.com/tos. We will try to notify you of material revisions via the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
      </p>

      <h1>Who May Use the Services</h1>
      <p>
        In order to use the Services, you must be at least 13 years old.  If you are using the Services on the behalf of an entity and not an individual person (such as on the behalf of an organization or a business) then you represent that entity and you warrant that you are authorized to bind this entity to our terms. 
      </p>

      <h1>Privacy</h1>
      <p>
        Your use of our Services indicates that you consent to our <a href="privacy">Privacy policy</a> and its terms.
      </p>

      <h1>Content</h1>
      <p>
        You are responsible for any Content you provide.  You are responsible for compliance with any law, rule, regulation or policy that is applicable to you.  Any and all content that you post onto our website is at your own risk.  We do not endorse, support, represent, or gurantee the completeness, truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any content that you post through our Services.  You understand that by using our Services you may be exposed to content that you may find offensive, harmful, triggering, deceptive, or otherwise inappropriate.  In these cases, please refer to our content policy and make use of our reporting features.  However, any and all content is the sole responsibility of the person who originated that content.  Caveart is not responsible for the content created by its users. 
      </p>

      <p>
      We reserve the right to remove content that violates our <a href="content">content policy</a>, from objectionable content to matters of copyright violation, impersonation and art theft.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition of a comic</h2>
      <p>
      Comic works must be legitimate expressions of sequential visual art: juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or to produce an aesthetic response in the viewer.  This does indeed mean that works like Family Circus are not considered comics on Cave Art.
      </p>

      <p>
      Comics may contain themes and content that is typically considered &lsquo;adult&rsquo; such as sex and violence and strong language, but they must fit the definition of a comic. Therefore, single-image illustrations are not valid submissions.  Exceptions will be made for single-panel uploads if they are contextually within what is otherwise a series of pages with multiple panels per page.
      </p>

      <h2>Sexual And Explicit Content</h2>
      <p>
        Comics may contain sexual or sensual content but may not depict sexual or sensual acts involving minors.  Anybody under the age of 18 is a minor.  A character will be considered a minor based on their physical appearance, so a childlike or youthful character will be considered a minor regardless of their chronological/canonical age in your story.
      </p>

      <p>
        Comics may not depict bestiality.  Anything depicting a human or anthropomorphic character engaging in a sexual act with an animal (aka non-morphic/feral) character will be considered bestiality. Animals with animals are fine.  Animals with non-animals are not.
      </p>

      <p>
        Comics may not promote or encourage violence or criminal acts in the real world.  Comics may not promote or encourage hostility based on identity or vulnerability. There is a difference between a comic that depicts bigotry, hate or violence and comics that <strong>encourage</strong> the same. The former is a part of writing, the latter is  grounds for removal from the platform.  We particularly do not tolerate users engaging in the incitement of violence, the denial or mockery of hate crimes (e.g. holocaust denial), or disparagement based on a particular characteristic (race, gender, ability, immigration status, etc).
      </p>

      <h2>Forum, Comments And Messaging</h2>
      <p>
        Users have channels by which to communicate with one another. Comments become harassment the moment they are described as unwelcome and yet persist.  When another user makes it clear that communication should stop, stop.  Continuing to contact that person in any way will be considered harassment and grounds for removal from the platform. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Behavior and situations on other platforms such as Discord or social media is typically not relevant to Caveart.  There are two exceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you share personally identifying information (PII) that you obtained through Caveart (for example, a naive user PMs you and tells you where they go to school) then we will ban you regardless of where, why, or how you share that information.  Don&rsquo;t dox people. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If a user draws a boundary with you (blocks you, tells you to stop talking to them) and you use another service to ignore that boundary, then even though you contacted them through another service, we will still treat it as if it happened on Caveart.  Boundaries are boundaries. Respect them or leave.
      </p>
      <p>
        When removing users based on their behavior on other platforms, we will do our best to vet that these accounts correspond to the right people.
      </p>

      <h1>Your Rights</h1>
      <p>
        You represent and warrant that the content you post is actually yours or that you have all necessary permissions and consent that legally entitle you to to post the material.
      </p>

      <p>
      You retain full rights to any content you submit, post, or display through our website.  Caveart will never attempt to assume ownership of your creations and anything that you used to create it (such as work in progress, photos, and so on).
      </p>

      <p>
      By posting or displaying content on Caveart, you are granting us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute your Content in any and all media or distribution methods.  What this means in plain English is that we have the right to do things like store your content on computers anywhere in the world and make as many backup copies as we need.  This is a normal part of making websites that host content.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are also granting us permission to feature your work (with credit given to you as the creator) in promotional material on other websites (such as social media advertisements) without compensation paid to you with respect to usage of this content. In these cases you are still entitled to credit for your work and we will consult you beforehand. We just are not going to pay you to advertise our platform with your work.  After all, the promotion is mutual.
      </p>

      <h1>Using The Services</h1>
      <p>
        We allow advertisements on Caveart.  You understand that advertisements and advertisers do not necessarily have a relationship with any given user or their content.  You therefore agree that an advertisement on a given comic page does not indicate that the comic&rsquo;s creator(s) somehow endorse the advertisement.  You also agree that an advertiser does not endorse the content of any given comic creator even if their ad ends up on a page you find objectionable.
      </p>

      <p>
        You also agree not to abuse our website or attempt to compromise its security.  For instance, you agree not to use the website for malicious and illegal purposes such as stalking somebody or attemt to circumvent any security or authentication measures.  If you fuck around anyway, don&rsquo;t get all pikachu faced with us when we ban you. 
      </p>
      <p>
      We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information regarding your activity that is legal for us to keep in order to enforce the terms or investigate instances of malicious or illegal behavior. We do not disclose personally-identifying information to third parties. The only exception would be if we were forced to by law.
      </p>

      <h1>Your Account</h1>
      <p>
      You are responsible for safeguarding your account.  It is up to you to pick a strong password and keep it secret, keep it safe.
      </p>

      <p>
      You consent to us contacting you through email in order to help you reset a forgotten password, provide a service announcement, or provide a security alert.  If the contact information you provide becomes no longer valid, it is up to you to update your contact information to help prevent us from communicating with the wrong person.
      </p>
